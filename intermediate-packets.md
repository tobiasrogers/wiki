# Intermediate packets

Tiago Forte argues that we need to change our conception of how we produce value from final deliverables to "intermediate packets." These packets are comprised of the research, brainstorms, examples, outlines, drafts, prototypes and other ideas that we create as reusable components for whatever end products we're building. 

There are a number of benefits to creating discrete intermediate deliverables rather than finished works: 

1. Create value in any span of time
2. Less intimidating
3. Become interruption proof
4. Better feedback 
5. Productivity flywheel
