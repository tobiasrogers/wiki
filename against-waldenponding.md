# Against Waldenponding

_**Against Woldenponding** is an argument popularised by writer and management consultant Venkatesh Rao that says Waldenponding \(the trend for disconnecting from technology and digital life\) doesn't work and that unplugging actually has a negative impact._ 

Rao argues that being plugged in is good and that there's valuable information at all levels from Twitter gossip to philosophy books. With the advent of the Internet and social media, we're now all part of a Giant Social Computer in the Cloud \(GSCITC\) and if we disconnect from it we'll default to the lowest-level job within; processing very low-latency information with small-minded cognition. 

Rather than disconnecting, what you should be doing \(according to Rao\) is learning to float between consuming information at different levels of latency and train your attention accordingly. In order to be successful in the digital age you have to be able to consume and act on information at all levels in a time-bound, temporally constrained way. If you disconnect entirely then you'll be left behind.
