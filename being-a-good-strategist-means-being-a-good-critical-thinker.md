# Being a good strategist means being a good critical thinker

To be a good strategist you need to be a good critical thinker. You should be reading lots of different books \(non-fiction and fiction\), not just biographies and history. Biographies and history books can give you ideas, but you need to be aware that history is contextual; something that worked in the past isn't guaranteed to work in the future if the context is different. If you follow the same steps as someone else, you're not necessarily going to end up with the same result.
