# Structuring individual Zettels

_**Structuring Individual Zettels** within your Zettelkasten should be standardised to make them easier to create and reference as your database grows._ 

Individual Zettels should represent one single idea and should be as concise and simple as possible. 

Each Zettel should include the following elements: 

1. Metadata
2. Content
3. Source\(s\)
4. Related Pages

[@trmsme](https://twitter.com/trmsme) recommends starting Zettels in a way that's similar to Wikipedia articles: 

> Have you ever noticed that Wikipedia articles always start with one sentence which repeats the title of the article and explains, in that one sentence only, what the item described by the article is? It is only after that point that background information, context, and examples are provided to increase understanding. [Source ](https://trms.me/some-thoughts-on-how-to-keep-a-zettelkasten)

The Content section contains the idea the Zettel is describing, the Links section contains links to other related Zettels within your Zettelkasten, the Source\(s\) section includes bibliographical info of the source of the idea plus links to external online sources.
