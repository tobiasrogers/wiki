# Creative compounding

_**Creative compounding** \(also described as the Digital Bannister Effect\) is a concept used by investor and writer Brett Bivens to describe the way in which human creativity has been compounded and accelerated by the Internet._ 

Using the example of high school and college basketball teams, Bivens explains how the Internet \(and social media in particular\) has enabled today's digital natives to develop their skills at far faster rates than in previous generations, primarily because they have instant access to vast amounts of knowledge at their fingertips. 

By sharing the creative process as it happens via YouTube channels, Twitter threads and Instagram posts, feedback can be invited far earlier than it would have in the past, thereby creating a flywheel that enhances the compounding effect.
