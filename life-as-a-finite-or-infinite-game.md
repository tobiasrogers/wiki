# Life as a finite or infinite game

_The choice of approaching **life as a finite or infinite game** can fundamentally impact your daily attitude and feeling of satisfaction. You need to decide whether life is a finite game you can win, or an infinite game that goes on forever._

According to James Carse, the Director of Religious Studies at New York University, playing to win at a finite game of life isn't as satisfying as playing to keep the game going. The main reason being that when you've won a finite game, you've got to sign up for another one and also find ways to showcase your winnings from the game you've just completed.

People who have chosen to be finite players find they have to parade their wealth and status and display conspicuous markers of the winning they have accumulated. These players are forced to live in the past, reviewing their winnings and finding ways to present them to others.

Infinite players, on the other hand, look to the future. When the goal is to keep the game going, there's far less need to focus on the past. When you're playing a non-repeatable game, you're more concerned with how to position yourself to deal with the challenges that are coming up.

How you choose to play also determines how you define success, what you need to achieve it, and the type of learning you pursue. Finite players need power and training, whereas infinite players need endurance and education.

They way you play also impacts on how you think about the game. As Carse explains:

> The finite play for life is serious; the infinite play of life is joyous.
