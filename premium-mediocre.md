# Premium mediocre

_**Premium mediocre** is a concept created by writer and consultant Venkatesh Rao to describe the modern habit of adding a premium sheen to mediocre products and services to make them more appealing._ 

Using examples like [The McDonald's Signature Collection](https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/latest/signature.html), he goes on to discuss how the idea has pervaded all aspects of contemporary society to the point where many people \(primarily young millennials\) can be described as living premium mediocre lives.
