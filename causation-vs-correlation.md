# Causation vs correlation

_**Causation and correlation** are often confused which leads to inaccurate assumptions  about the way the world works. We notice two things happening at the same time \(correlation\) and mistakenly conclude that one causes the other \(causation\)._

The correlation coefficient is a measure between -1 and 1 of the relative weight of the factors shared between two different measures. Two measures can be described as having no correlation \(e.g. the relationship between bottled water sales and suicide\), perfect correlation \(e.g. the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit\), or weak to moderate correlation \(e.g. the relationship between height and weight\). 

Just because two different measures have a correlation, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. When correlation is imperfect, extremes will soften over time regardless of any additional action \(regression to the mean\) which can often be mistakenly diagnosed as causation when the effect would have happened anyway.
