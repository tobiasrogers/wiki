# Four kinds of notes

_According to Sonke Ahrens in How to Take Smart Notes, there are **four kinds of notes** that have different amounts of value and usefulness._

**Fleeting notes**

These are throwaway notes that are created purely to remember your thoughts. They could be fleeting ideas, notes you would have written in the margins of a book, quotes you would have underlined in a book. They have no value other than as stepping stones to creating more permanent notes.

**Literature notes**

Literature notes summarise the content of part of a text and give a citation. These could be literature notes taken for a specific project, or could be the basis of permanent notes within your Zettelkasten.

**Permanent notes**

Each permanent note contains one idea, explained fully, in complete sentences. Permanent notes \(Zettels\) are the key components of a Zettelkasten.

**Project notes**

These are notes that are made for a specific project. They could be notes that collect all the relevant permanent notes for an article or paper, notes created as part of the project planning process, or reference notes. These notes are usually thrown away once a project is completed.
