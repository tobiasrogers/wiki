# Intermediate packets are the MVPs of knowledge work

Intermediate packets are the minimum viable products of knowledge work and form the building blocks of larger, finished deliverables. The concept is described by productivity consultant Tiago Forte in his article Bending The Curves Of Productivity. 

Tiago Forte argues that we need to change our conception of how we produce value from final deliverables to "intermediate packets." These packets are comprised of the research, brainstorms, examples, outlines, drafts, prototypes and other ideas that we create as reusable components for whatever end products we're building.

Creating and sharing intermediate packets lets knowledge workers deliver value quickly and is essential for learning and innovation. It's less intimidating than trying to create final deliverables in one sitting, provides opportunities for feedback at a much earlier stage in the creative process, and allows value to be created within any available timescale \(effectively making knowledge workers distraction-proof\).
