# You should keep a dozen of your favourite problems constantly present in your mind

[Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), a Nobel Prize winning physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project put his ability to continually make significant discoveries in his field down to the simple habit of keeping a dozen favourite problems present in his mind then testing new tricks, results and other information against them to see if they moved him closer to a solution. 

> You have to keep a dozen of your favourite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!” ~ Richard Feynmann
