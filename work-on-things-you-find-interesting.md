# Work on things you find interesting

Interesting-ness is one of the most important factors for deciding what to work on. In his summary of Sonke Ahren's How To Take Smart Notes, Tiago Forte references the fact that one of the main reasons students fail at learning is because they lose connection with what they're learning about.

You won't know what's going to be interesting to you personally until you find out more about it so you should just "go with the flow". DNA was only discovered because the team of researchers who discovered it let themselves follow the path of interesting-ness; their grant was actually to try and find a cure for cancer.
