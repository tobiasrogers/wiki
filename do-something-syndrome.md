# Do something syndrome

_**Do something syndrome** is the false assumption that motion is better than inaction._ 

Movement offers shelter from failure. When you're moving, you feel like you're heading somewhere but this often isn't the case. Movement teases with the illusion of progress, but action doesn't always equate to results. 

Often we mistake the actions we take for the things we really want to accomplish. We read diet books instead of dieting, we learn how to use Spotify instead of starting a store. By confusing preparation with end results, we trick ourselves into thinking we're achieving success. 

Doing something isn't the same as getting results. The problem is we often believe that doing something or doing nothing are our only options. We forget that there's a third option; gathering more information. We'd be much better off if we stopped for a moment before acting.
