# Falsification

_**Falsification** is the process of trying to test the validity of a theory by trying to prove it wrong._ 

Falsification is something we typically do poorly_**.**_ We instinctively look for  information that proves our intuition, rather than disproves it. In order to properly test our ideas, we need to get into the habit of trying to find evidence that falsifies what we believe to be true.
