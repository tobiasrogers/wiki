# The red queen effect

_**The red queen effect** is mental model that takes its name from Lewis Carroll's timeless classic, Through The Looking Glass, where Alice is schooled by the Red Queen in the important life lesson; sometimes you run faster and faster but end up staying in the same place._ 

> _“Well in our country you’d generally get to somewhere else – if you ran very fast for a long time as we’ve been doing.” “A slow sort of country!” says the Queen. “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"_

The core premise of the Red Queen Effect is that complacency leads to falling behind. To survive another day, we need to run fast and hard, and co-evolve with the systems we interact with. Regardless of our role, we're all embedded in our own Red Queen battle. We need to find ways to run smarter so we can keep moving forward. 

A concept often used in evolutionary biology, finance and business, The Red Queen Effect can also be applied to personal development and growth. If we want to retain our competitive advantage, we've got to ensure we're continually moving forwards, by developing our situation and working out new ways to keep playing the infinite game of life.
