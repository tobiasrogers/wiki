# The first mile of product

_**The first mile of product** is a term coined by Behance founder and Adobe Chief Product Officer Scott Belsky to describe a user's first experience of a new product._ 

The first mile is often neglected as a result of the tendency to gravitate towards your best customers. But if you want to build products that millions \(or even hundreds of millions\) of people use, then you've got to prioritize the first user experience. 

A failed first mile cripples a product. You may get loads of downloads or sign-ups, but very few customers will get onboarded to the point where they know: 

1. Why they're there
2. What they can accomplish 
3. What to do next 

Once users know these three things, they've reached "The Zone". The best businesses are ones that are able to get the majority of users who express an interest in their product into "The Zone". This is the job of the first mile. 

A fantastic first mile has to do the following: 

* Optimize for the first 15 seconds of laziness, vanity and selfishness
* Do &gt; Show &gt; Explain 
* Accommodate ego analytics
* Provide immediate novelty or utility
* Nail defaults and empty states
* Be more accommodating, less retraining

As Scott Belsky says: 

> _The first mile of your customerâ€™s experience using your product cannot be the last mile of your experience building the product._

The first mile is a critical component of your product's long-term success needs to be the most thought-out part of your product, not an afterthought.
