# different types of notes

_There are four different types of notes:_

**Fleeting notes**_:_  
These are the temporary notes we create to capture our thoughts. Really, they exist purely as stepping stones; as incubators for ideas before they're deemed worthy to be transferred into a permanent knowledge management system or discarded.

**Literature notes:**  
These are notes that summarize the content of some kind of textâ€”a book, an article etc. They'll usually include a quote and a citation or link back to the source. The format of the citation doesn't really matter but it makes sense to keep it consistent throughout your knowledge management system.

**Permanent notes:**  
These are the Niklas Luhmann-style "zettels" that end up in your permanent slip-box. Each note should contain one idea, explained fully in complete sentences like an intermediate packet of a completed academic paper.

**Project notes:**  
These are notes that are created for a specific project. They could be notes that collect all the permanent notes you'd want to include within a writing project or brainstorming and planning notes. Like your fleeting notes, this can usually be discarded once the project is complete.
