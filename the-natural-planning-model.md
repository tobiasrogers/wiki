# The natural planning model

The natural planning model is an approach to project planning based on the way our brains naturally plan, described by productivity consultant [David Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_%28author%29) in the book [Getting Things Done](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done).

The natural planning model is a five-step planning model that works for any kind of project, regardless of size and scope. 

The five steps are: 

1. Purpose
2. Vision
3. Ideas
4. Structure
5. Next Action

This is based on the way our brains naturally plan and is the best way to get clarity on a project or to move an idea from impulse to reality. 

Allen describes any other planning process as "unnatural" and adds:

> The "unnatural planning model" is what we usually end up doing which isn't really productive. "Who has a good idea?" isn't a great place to startâ€”it causes resistance. If you don't plan you get a lack of clarity and stress which leads to "reactive planning".
