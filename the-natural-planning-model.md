# The natural planning model

_**The natural planning model** is an approach to project planning based on the way our brains naturally plan, described by productivity consultant David Allen in the book Getting Things Done._

The natural planning model is a five-step planning model that works for any kind of project, regardless of size and scope. 

The five steps are: 

1. Purpose
2. Vision
3. Ideas
4. Structure
5. Next Action

This is based on the way our brains naturally plan and is the best way to get clarity on a project or to move an idea from impulse to reality. 

David Allen describes any other planning process as "unnatural" and adds: 

> It's not about whether you do the natural planning model, it's about when and at what cost.

Allen's TEDx Talk on [Getting In Control and Creating Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOSFxKaqOm4&t=861s) is an excellent introduction to the model.
