# The natural planning model

In his seminal productivity book, [Getting Things Done](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done), David Allen describes a five-step planning model that works for any kind of project: 

1. Purpose
2. Vision
3. Ideas
4. Structure
5. Next Action

This is based on the way your brain naturally plans and is the best way to get clarity on a project or to move an idea from impulse to reality. He describes any other planning process as "unnatural" and adds: 

> It's not about whether you do the natural planning model, it's about when and at what cost.

His TEDx Talk on [Getting In Control and Creating Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOSFxKaqOm4&t=861s) is an excellent introduction to the model.
