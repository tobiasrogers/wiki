# Gall's law

_**Gall's law** is a rule of thumb for systems design that states that a complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system._

Gall's law has strong affinities with agile software development and is an argument in favour of underspecification. It can be used to explain the success of systems like the World Wide Web and the failure of systems like CORBA. 

The philosophy can also be attributed to extreme programming, which encourages doing the simplest thing first and adding features later.
