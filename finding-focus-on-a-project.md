# Finding focus on a project

_Facebook's VP of Product, Fidji SImo, asks the following questions to help **find focus on a project**:_ 

1. What is the main problem this product is solving? 
2. Who are the people we are solving this problem for? 
3. What is the emotion/feeling we want our product to create or evoke? 
4. Is this particular implementation aligned with the problem we're solving for? 
5. Is this the product/feature most likely to successfully solve the problem?
