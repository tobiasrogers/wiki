# Aligning actions with intention

_Facebook's VP of Product, Fidji Simo, blocks off 30â€”60 minutes on her calendar every Monday morning to ensure she's **aligning actions with intention**._ 

Simo's meeting has a set agenda to help her find focus and clarify her objectives for the coming week: 

1. List the broader team or organization's priorities
2. Check that your personal priorities for the week still align with those priorities
3. Check for any new information or data that requires a shift in priorities
4. Check priorities against your time allocation, meetings and commitments that week
5. Make any adjustments to your calendar to better reflect your priorities
6. Note any priority adjustments that impact or need to be communicated to your team
