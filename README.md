# hello

## Why am I doing this?

I've recently become interested in building a second brain of notes, resources and other useful information I can use to supercharge future projects. Instead of keeping it all to myself in my notes app, I think there's real value in making my thinking public. 

[Brett Bivens](https://twitter.com/brettbivens) talks a lot about [creative compounding and "the digital Bannister effect"](https://twitter.com/brettbivens/status/1167411739153113090) which applies to knowledge as much as it does to sports. By making my learning public, I'm hoping I can accelerate my personal development in a similar way.

## Who is this for?

Really, this wiki is a place for me to curate my knowledge and make it shareable. Some of it probably won't make sense to everyone, but if other people get some value out of it, that's great. 

I regularly find myself sharing the same links, notes and ideas so it makes sense to keep them all in one place. [Scott Hanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman) talks about [conserving your keystrokes](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmansCompleteListOfProductivityTips.aspx) and that's exactly what I'm trying to do here. 

> If Brian emails me a really interesting question about ASP.net … and I send him back an exciting and long, five-paragraph with a code sample email that solves his problem, I just gave him the gift of 10,000 of my keystrokes. But there is a finite number of keystrokes left in my hands before I die, and I am never going to get those keystrokes back and I've just gifted them to Brian. And I don't even know if he reads that email. So what should I do to multiply these keystrokes given that there is a finite number of those keystrokes left in my hands? I write a blog post and I mail him the link. Then after I'm dead, my keystrokes multiply—every time I get a page view that's 5,000 keystrokes that I did not have to type.

I've unashamedly borrowed parts of the structure and layout for this wiki from [brendex](https://ltkmn.gitbook.io/brendex/) and [Nikita Voloboev](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev)'s [Everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/). Make sure you check them out.
