# Intro

Hi! I'm [**Toby Rogers**](https://tobyrogers.pm/). Welcome to my personal [**digital garden**](digital-gardens.md). This whole site probably doesn't make a lot of sense if you've found your way here by accident, so here's a bit of context. 

I've been capturing my thoughts and ideas in various note-taking tools for years, but I've never really put them to good use. I've been a victim of [**the collector's fallacy**](the-collectors-fallacy.md) and have built up a huge archive of digital information that's gathering virtual dust. 

After reading about [**The Zettelkasten method**](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) and stumbling across [**Andy Matuschak's working notes**](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), I decided to try and re-ignite my note-taking by building my own knowledge management system using the same ideas. I initially set up my slip box in Evernote, but I've decided to make it public via this Gitbook-powered site. Why? Because I'm a firm believer in the value of [**working with the garage door up**](working-with-the-garage-door-up.md) ****and inviting feedback into the creative process. 

The notes on this site are living [**packets of value**](intermediate-packets-are-the-mvps-of-knowledge-work.md) that I'm using to create other content, but if other people find them useful then that's okay too.
