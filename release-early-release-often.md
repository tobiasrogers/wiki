# Release early, release often

_**Release early, release often \(RERO\)** is a software development philosophy usually attributed to Linux architect Linus Torvalds that emphasises releasing code as early as possible and as frequently as possible to create a tight_ f_eedback loop between developers and users._ 

Release early, release often is one of the cornerstones of Agile development. In modern software development, it's usually faster and cheaper to learn from failure than to try and anticipate and accommodate it through detailed Waterfall-style planning processes. Often restated as failing fast, the RERO principle underpins the philosophy of many global organisations \(Facebook, Google, Amazon etc\) and is essential for startups trying to find product-market fit.
