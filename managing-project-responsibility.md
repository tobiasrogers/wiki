# managing project responsibility

A RASCI matrix is one of the best ways to keep track of each person's involvement with the deliverables for a project:

> A RASCI matrix allows you to chart who is responsible for which aspect of a task on a project. For each task, a person can have one of five roles, which break down as follows:
>
> * **Responsible:** This is the person who does the work to complete the task.
> * **Accountable:** This is the person responsible for overseeing that the task is done, and done correctly.
> * **Consulted:** This person may be used to weigh in on the task, but is not necessarily responsible for doing the work on it.
> * **Support:** This person is assigned to help the Responsible person. Like Consulted, but provides additional work.
> * **Informed:** People who are neither responsible for doing the work, nor responsible for overseeing its completion, but who should be kept up-to-date on its progress. [source](https://lifehacker.com/use-the-rasci-matrix-to-manage-responsibility-on-a-proj-1753137259)
