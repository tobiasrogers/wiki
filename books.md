# books

I read every day. Blog posts, short stories, novels, biographies, self-help books, business books, screenplays, graphic novels, comics, poetry \(well, maybe not poetry\); I consume millions of words every year.

I keep ongoing Twitter threads of [books I'm reading](https://twitter.com/tobiasrogers/status/1172866767338770432?s=20) and [want to read](https://twitter.com/tobiasrogers/status/1180125156682997762?s=20) in the future. I also keep lists in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53172302-toby-rogers).
