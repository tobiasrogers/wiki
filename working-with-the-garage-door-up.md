# Working with the garage door up

The idea of working with the garage door up comes from [**Robin Sloan**](https://www.robinsloan.com/) \(via [**Andy Matuschak**](https://andymatuschak.org/)\) ****and describes the concept of creating in public in order to invite feedback and criticism at the earliest possible stage of the process.

### **References:**

> One of my favorite ways that creative people communicate is by “working with their garage door up,” to steal Robin Sloan’s phrase. This is the opposite of the Twitter account which mostly posts announcements of finished work: it’s [Screenshot Saturday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/screenshotsaturday?lang=en); it’s giving a lecture about the problems you’re pondering in the shower; it’s thinking out loud about the ways in which your project doesn’t work at all. It’s so much of Twitch. I want to see the process. I want to see you trim the artichoke. I want to see you choose the color palette.
