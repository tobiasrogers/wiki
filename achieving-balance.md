# Achieving balance

[Julie Zhuo](https://www.juliezhuo.com/) argues that work-life balance comes from defining your priorities then letting them guide your daily actions: 

> At the end of the day, achieving balance means that our actions flow from our big-picture priorities. It means we get out of reacting daily to what’s thrown our way and instead make intentional decisions to follow the life plan _we_ want, not what someone else tells us we should want. It means sitting down with paper and pen every once in a while and thinking until our brains hurt about who we are uniquely and what will give us meaning in the short snatch of time we have on this earth. It means saying “no” to priority number 28 and not feeling guilty or bad about it because you know you’re saying “yes” to priorities 1, 2 and 3.
