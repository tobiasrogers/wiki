# digital streams, campfires and gardens

There are three ways we consume and create information online: streams, campfires and gardens.

> Loosely speaking - streams are for fast twitch thinking and acting. Participating in the stream is a fast feedback loop, with a slightly longer undercurrent of connection building.
>
> This is where fast twitch information discovery happens. The firehose of content. But with an undercurrent of creating new connections.

> Campfires - mostly blogging. A digital campfire \(or a series of campfires\) that are slower burn but fade relatively quickly over the timeframe of years. This builds muscle, articulates thinking and is the connective tissue between ideas, people and more.

> Gardens - This is the wiki layer. Curate, connect and explore information. Decades-spanning project of information sensemaking. [source](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/)
