  There are three ways we consume and create information online: streams,
  campfires and gardens.

# digital streams, campfires and gardens

[Tom Critchlow](https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow) summarises of how we can build different learning environments across different information consumption time horizons in his [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) blog post:

> Loosely speaking - streams are for fast twitch thinking and acting. Participating in the stream is a fast feedback loop, with a slightly longer undercurrent of connection building.
>
> This is where fast twitch information discovery happens. The firehose of content. But with an undercurrent of creating new connections.

> Campfires - mostly blogging. A digital campfire \(or a series of campfires\) that are slower burn but fade relatively quickly over the timeframe of years. This builds muscle, articulates thinking and is the connective tissue between ideas, people and more.

> Gardens - This is the wiki layer. Curate, connect and explore information. Decades-spanning project of information sensemaking. [source](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/)

[Mike Caulfield](https://twitter.com/holden) also talks about digital gardens and streams in a lot more detail in his epic [The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) article: 

> Just imagine that instead of blogging and tweeting your experience you wiki’d it. And over time the wiki became a representation of things you knew, connected to other people’s wikis about things they knew.

> The predominant form of the social web — that amalgam of blogging, Twitter, Facebook, forums, Reddit, Instagram — is an impoverished model for learning and research and that our survival as a species depends on us getting past the sweet, salty fat of “the web as conversation” and on to something more timeless, integrative, iterative, something less personal and less self-assertive, something more solitary yet more connected.

> We create the garden as a sort of experience generator, capable of infinite expression and meaning.\[...\] building out a network of often conflicting information into a web that can generate insights, iterating it, allowing that to grow into something bigger than a single event, a single narrative, or single meaning.
