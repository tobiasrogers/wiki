# portfolio approaches to work

In the future many knowledge workers won't be salaried employees of individual companies, they'll be full-stack freelancers managing their own portfolios of income streams: 

> Full-Stack Freelancers respond to technology as an opportunity, not a threat. They leverage software-as-a-service and online platforms to vertically integrate a “full stack” of capabilities, instead of focusing on one narrow function. This allows them to capture a much greater percentage of the value they create, instead of giving it away to gatekeepers and distribution bottlenecks.
>
> Full-Stack Freelancers are responding to a series of technology-driven trends — contingent employment, intensifying globalization, and automation — by taking advantage of the other side of the coin: technology finally becoming powerful enough, cheap enough, and user-friendly enough to be deployed productively by a single individual.
>
> They borrow freely — from tech startups, digital nomads, lifestyle designers, independent contractors, the sharing and peer-to-peer economies — but placing them squarely inside any of these categories is not quite right.
>
> That’s because Full-Stack Freelancers manage a _portfolio of income streams_, not a _job based on one set of skills_. [source](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/the-rise-of-the-full-stack-freelancer-c14a375445d9/)
