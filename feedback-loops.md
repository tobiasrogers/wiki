# Feedback loops

_**Feedback loops** are created when reactions affect themselves and can be positive or negative._ 

A good example of a feedback loop is a thermostat regulating the temperature of a room. As the temperature rises, the thermostat turns off the boiler allowing the room to rest at a predetermined temperature. When the temperature falls below the predetermined level, the thermostat automatically switches the boiler back on. 

According to William Lidwell, Jill Butler and Kritina Holden in [Universal Principles of Design](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1592535879?ie=UTF8&linkCode=gs2&tag=farstrblo-21&creative=392969&camp=213689): 

> Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. When reactions loop back to affect themselves, a feedback loop is created. All real-world systems are composed of many such interacting feedback loops — animals, machines, businesses, and ecosystems, to name a few. There are two types of feedback loops: positive and negative. Positive feedback amplifies system output, resulting in growth or decline. Negative feedback dampers output, stabilizes the system around an equilibrium point.

One of the key lessons of feedback loops is that all things are connected—changing one variable in a system will affect other variables in that system and other associated systems.
