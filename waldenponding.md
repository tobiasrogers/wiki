# Waldenponding

_**Waldenponding** is a term coined by writer and management consultant Venkatesh Rao to describe various levels of retreating from technology. The concept is taken from the book Walden by Henry David Thoreau where Thoreau extols the virtues of retreating from social contact and living a quieter life in a cabin at Walden Pond._ 

Waldenponding describes the act of dealing with our technology and data-rich world by disconnecting through digital detoxes, deleting Facebook and dumbing down our smartphones. Or, as Rao puts it: 

> The crude caricature is ‘smash your smart phone and go live in a log cabin to reclaim your attention and your life from being hacked by evil social media platforms'.

Rao suggests there are varying degrees of Waldenponding, from hard \(completely disconnecting from the digital world\) to soft \(installing an app like Forest\), but all fail to take into account the idea that retreating from information flows is just a different way of having your attention hacked by others.
