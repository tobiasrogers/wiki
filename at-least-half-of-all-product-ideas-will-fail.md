# At least half of all product ideas will fail

At least 50% of all new product and feature ideas will fail for a number of different reasons: 

* Customers aren't as excited about a ****product/feature as everyone thought so they don't actually use it
* Customers want to  use the product/feature but it's too complicated so it ends up being more trouble than it's worth 
* Customers would love the product/feature but it's too expensive to deliver so it doesn't end up getting built 

The best teams assume that at least three-quarters of their ideas won't work and plan accordingly. 

Even with ideas that have potential, it usually takes a number of iterations for them to get to the point where they deliver real value for the customer and the business.

> The first truth is that at least half of our ideas are just not going to work. There are many reasons for an idea to not work out. The most common is that the customers just aren’t as excited about this idea as we are. So they choose not to use it. Sometimes they want to use it, but they try it out and it’s so complicated that it’s simply more trouble than it’s worth, which ends up as the same result – the users don’t choose to use it. Sometimes the issue is that the customers would love it but it turns out to be much more involved to build than we thought, and we decide we simply can’t afford the time and money to actually deliver.
