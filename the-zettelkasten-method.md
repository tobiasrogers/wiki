# The Zettelkasten method

_**The Zettelkasten method**_ _is a knowledge management system made popular by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. From the German for "slip box", a Zettelkasten is a semi-structured collection of interlinked notes originally stored as index cards in a cabinet._ 

The basic principle of the Zettelkasten method is to store individual ideas in small-ish packets \(e.g. one idea or concept per note\) and create hyperlinks between related ideas. 

Rather than having predetermined categories, notes in a Zettelkasten are stored in a loose structure \(e.g. by date, title or ID order\) that encourages "relatedness" to serendipitously emerge as ideas are interacted with.
