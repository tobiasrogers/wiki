# Black swan theory

_**Black swan theory** is a metaphor_  _first developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to describe the impact of events that come as a surprise, have a major effect, and are inappropriately rationalised after the fact with the benefit of hindsight._ 

The theory was developed to describe an event that has the following three attributes: 

1. It is an outlierâ€“it lies beyond the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past points to it as a possibility
2. It carries an extreme impact
3. In spite of its outlier status, human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact 

> A small number of Black Swans explain almost everything in our world, from the success of ideas and religions, to the dynamics of historical events, to elements of our own personal lives. Ever since we left the Pleistocene, some ten millennia ago, the effect of these Black Swans has been increasing. It started accelerating during the industrial revolution, as the world started getting more complicated, while ordinary events, the ones we study and discuss and try to predict from reading the newspapers, have become increasingly inconsequential.

Black Swan logic makes what you don't know far more relevant than what you do know. What we need to do is try and adjust to their existence, focus on anti-knowledge \(what we don't know\), and set ourselves up to serendipitously collect Black Swans by maximising exposure to them.
