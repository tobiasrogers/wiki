# weekly review

[David Allen](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) says if you're not doing your weekly review, you're not doing GTD. I've been updating and tweaking mine for more than a decade, but after reading [Tiago Forte's article on how he treats his as his operating system,](https://www.newsblur.com/newsletters/story/6798656:038a9c) I've settled on these steps \(for now, anyway\): 

* Process my email inboxes \(work, personal\) 
* Process my Slack mentions, DMs and unreads 
* Process my social media notifications and messages 
* Check my calendar \(-2/+4 weeks\) 
* Clear my computer downloads folder 
* Clear my phone downloads folder 
* Review my financial transactions 
* Process my Evernote inbox 
* Process my Todoist inbox 
* Review my Projects list 
* Review my "Larger Outcomes" lists 
* Purge my Pocket unread articles 
* Review my "Waiting For" list for follow-ups 
* Decide on my top three priorities for the coming week 
* Schedule some focus time in my calendar for my priorities
