# The collector's fallacy

The collector's fallacy is the tendency in all of us to gather stuff and feel like we're making progress. It's the process of bookmarking websites, highlighting passages in articles, writing in the margins of books, and building huge digital archives of reference material we might \(or more likely might not\) use in the future. 

The reason it's a fallacy is because knowing about something isn't anywhere near as valuable as knowing something. Gathering information isn't the same as gathering knowledge. To do that successfully we've got to assimilate ideas from the information we're gathering and utilise them effectively to learn and develop.

> There’s a tendency in all of us to gather useful stuff and feel good about it. To collect is a reward in itself. As knowledge workers, we’re inclined to look for the next groundbreaking thought, for intellectual stimulation: we pile up promising books and articles, and we store half the internet as bookmarks, just so we get the feeling of being on the cutting edge.

> Let’s call this “The Collector’s Fallacy”. Why fallacy? Because ‘to know about something’ isn’t the same as ‘knowing something’. Just knowing about a thing is less than superficial since knowing about is merely to be certain of its existence, nothing more. Ultimately, this fake-knowledge is hindering us on our road to true excellence. Until we merge the contents, the information, ideas, and thoughts of other people into our own knowledge, we haven’t really learned a thing. We don’t change ourselves if we don’t learn, so merely filing things away doesn’t lead us anywhere.
