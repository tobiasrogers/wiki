# Confirmation bias

_**Confirmation bias** is the tendency to cherry-pick information that confirms our existing beliefs and ideas._ 

We naturally seek to confirm our existing beliefs, rather than question them or seek out new ones, but this can lead to serious misjudgements. Once we understand this, we can learn to identify it and be cautious of data that seems to immediately support our views. 

According to Ziva Kunda, we give special weight to information that allows us to come to the conclusion we want to reach. Accepting information that confirms our beliefs is easy and requires little mental energy. It's much harder to question our beliefs and actively seek out information that disproves them. 

Confirmation bias is such an ingrained cognitive shortcut  that our general assimilation of information is subject to deep bias based on our worldview. As a result, we're drawn subconsciously to evidence that supports it. We need to learn to stop ignoring contradictory evidence and get better at thinking critically about our existing beliefs.
