# The most critical part of strategic planning is listing your assumptions

The most important part of strategic planning is listing, challenging and validating the assumptions you're making. You'll make assumptions without even thinking about it; if you're going to develop a robust strategy, then you've got to take the time to list those assumptions and aggressively challenge them. 

Ask yourself some basic questions to validate your assumptions: 

*  If thatâ€™s true, what should I expect to see?
* What would I have to know or accept in order to believe that could be true?
* How do I know?
