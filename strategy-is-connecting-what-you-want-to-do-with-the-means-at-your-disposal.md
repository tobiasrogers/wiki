# Strategy is connecting what you want to do with the means at your disposal

At its most straightforward, strategy is the process of connecting what you want to do with the means you have at your disposal to achieve it. As an example, if you're goal is to reach a specific destination, your strategy is the "how" based on your circumstances \(can you afford to fly, are you going to have to hitchhike etc.\) 

[Being a good strategist means being a good critical thinker](being-a-good-strategist-means-being-a-good-critical-thinker.md). You need to have a wide body of knowledge from a wide range of sources that you can draw on to apply to your vision of where you're heading.
